# Research Question: How well do AI models understand human personality traits?  

We propose developing a program that randomizes character traits and generates a story based on those traits using the ChatGPT API. The resulting story will then be evaluated by us—and potentially a professor—to assess how accurately the AI translates the given traits into a narrative. Next, we will test other large language models (LLMs) to compare their interpretations of personality traits. Additionally, we will design programs to examine how the models’ understanding of a character’s personality shifts when more details are introduced into the story or when multiple models are used for comparison.
